<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        A simple script to create ARM template JSON files from Bicep code.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Depending upon which folder of a repo this script is run from, it
        will either Bicep build definitions, initiatives or assignements
        to be later consumed for Template Spec deployment in the following
        tasks. Note that the "definitions" folder will contain sub-folders
        below it, thus it will hit the first condition and loop over each
        sub folder.
